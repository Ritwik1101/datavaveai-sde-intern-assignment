# Project Structure:
# -----------------------------
# data/                  --> Contains the CSV file for one person's bank data.
# output/                --> Stores the outputs generated by running the scripts.
# ├─ final_score.txt     --> Risk score saved from the model.
# └─ credit_report.pdf   --> Final PDF report generated.

# pipeline.py            --> (optional) for analysis and features.
# risk_model.py          --> Core file to calculate the credit-worthiness score.
# report_generator.py    --> Generates the PDF report from the score.


# -----------------------------
# How to Run This Project:
# -----------------------------

# Step 1: Run risk_model.py

# This script:
# - Reads the CSV file
# - Engineers features like avg_balance, inflow, outflow, anomaly_days
# - Creates fake variations of the data for training
# - Trains a logistic regression model
# - Saves the final score to output/final_score.txt
python risk_model.py

# Step 2: Run report_generator.py

# This script:
# - Reads the score saved in final_score.txt
# - Writes a clean PDF report with the score, a summary, and recommendation
# - Saves the report to output/credit_report.pdf
python report_generator.py


# -----------------------------
# Output Files:
# -----------------------------
# output/final_score.txt      --> Contains the credit-worthiness score (0-100)
# output/credit_report.pdf    --> Final PDF report


# -----------------------------
# Where & How I Used LLM (ChatGPT):
# -----------------------------

# Prompt I gave ChatGPT:
# Write a business-style classification report paragraph for a credit-worthiness PDF. 
# It should sound like a professional banker wrote it. Assume the account has moderate inflow, 
# some spending irregularities, and average balance.

# ChatGPT Response I used:
# "Account A demonstrates moderate financial stability. While the account maintains a steady inflow of funds,
# occasional irregularities in spending and a lower average balance indicate moderate risk.
# The assigned credit-worthiness score reflects this evaluation."

# How I used ChatGPT:
# - To generate the business-style PDF summary paragraph.
# - To ask how to easily generate PDFs in Python (ChatGPT suggested using FPDF).


# -----------------------------
# Challenges I Faced & Solutions:
# -----------------------------

# 1️⃣ Problem: Not enough data to train a model (only one account).
#    Solution: Generated fake variations by adding noise to avg_balance and anomaly_days.

# 2️⃣ Problem: Model accuracy showed 1.0, seemed unrealistic.
#    Solution: Understood this is expected due to toy synthetic data. Accepted it.

# 3️⃣ Problem: "File not found" for output folder.
#    Solution: Added os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True) to ensure the folder exists.

# 4️⃣ Problem: PDF showed as "unknown file type" on Windows.
#    Solution: Opened with Chrome to verify the PDF was valid.


# -----------------------------
# What This Project Demonstrates:
# -----------------------------
# - Analyzing financial transaction data.
# - Risk scoring using basic machine learning (Logistic Regression).
# - Generating professional PDF reports.
# - Using LLMs (ChatGPT) for writing and technical help.
